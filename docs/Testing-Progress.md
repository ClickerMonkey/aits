- ✅ Created implementation checklist

### 2. Core Package (`@aits/core`)

**Infrastructure** ✅
- Installed Jest, ts-jest, @types/jest
- Created `jest.config.js` with proper configuration
- Set up test directory structure

**Mock Utilities** ✅
- `__tests__/mocks/executor.mock.ts` - Mock executors with configurable responses
- `__tests__/mocks/streamer.mock.ts` - Mock streamers with chunk control
- `__tests__/mocks/fixtures.ts` - Common test data and fixtures

**Test Files** ✅
- `__tests__/types.test.ts` - Type utility tests (4 tests, all passing)
- `__tests__/tool.test.ts` - Tool component tests (19 tests, all passing)

**Test Coverage**
- Types: 100% (accumulateUsage function fully tested)
- Tool: ~85% (construction, validation, execution, error handling, compilation, applicability)

**Total Tests**: 23/23 passing ✅

### 3. AI Package (`@aits/ai`)

**Infrastructure** ✅
- Installed Jest dependencies
- Created `jest.config.js` with 75% coverage threshold
- Set up test directory structure

**Mock Utilities** ✅
- `__tests__/mocks/provider.mock.ts` - Complete mock provider implementation
  - Mock chat, image, transcription, speech, embedding
  - Configurable delays and errors
  - Failing provider for error testing
  - Rate-limited provider for throttling tests

## Example Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests in all packages
npm test

# Run tests for specific package
npm test --workspace=@aits/core
npm test --workspace=@aits/ai

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- types.test.ts

# Run integration tests (requires API keys)
npm run test:integration
```

## Known Issues

### Core Package
- ⚠️ Jest ts-jest warnings about deprecated config (non-breaking)
- ⚠️ Prompt and Agent tests not yet implemented (complex components)

### AI Package
- ℹ️ No tests implemented yet

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. ✅ Set up AI package test infrastructure
2. ✅ Create mock provider
3. ⏭️ Write AI package tests (registry, selection, APIs)
4. ⏭️ Complete core package tests (Prompt, Agent)

### Short Term (Next Session)
1. Set up provider package tests
2. Write OpenAI provider unit tests
3. Set up integration test framework
4. Create `.env.test.example`

### Medium Term
1. Write integration tests for all providers
2. Create multi-provider test package
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Achieve coverage goals

## Test Quality Checklist

For each test file, ensure:
- ✅ Happy path scenarios covered
- ✅ Error scenarios covered
- ✅ Edge cases covered
- ✅ Async operations handled correctly
- ✅ Mocks properly configured
- ✅ Test names are descriptive
- ✅ Tests are isolated (no shared state)
- ✅ Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)
